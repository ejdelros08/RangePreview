# RangePreview

<b>RangePreview</b> is a <i>Custom View</i> which acts as a range selector within a specified video showing frames from the video source on each computed interval

I've searched for a library like https://github.com/itsmeichigo/ICGVideoTrimmer on android but I can't find any so i've tried to at create my own implementation.
It's not as good as intstagram's or this library above. But I think this will do at least for the purpose I needed on my app.
This project is open for improvements.


<b>How to use:</b>

Just add to your XML
```xml
<com.optimind.studiotest.views.RangePreview
        android:id="@+id/range_preview"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="0dp"
        android:layout_weight=".2" />
```
